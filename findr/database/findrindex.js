  { title: "Mini Articles - Hard Disk Drive", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", description: "A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information. It consists of one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material, with read/write heads positioned on an arm to read and write data to the surfaces. HDDs are commonly used for storing large amounts of data and are characterized by their high capacity and lower cost per gigabyte compared to SSDs, though they are slower and more susceptible to physical damage due to their moving parts." },
  { title: "Mini Articles - Heat Sink", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink", description: "A Heat Sink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, to prevent the device from overheating. Heat sinks are commonly used in CPUs, GPUs, and other high-performance components to maintain optimal operating temperatures. They work by increasing the surface area in contact with the cooling medium, often using fins or other structures, to dissipate heat more effectively." },
  { title: "Mini Articles - Motherboard", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", description: "A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer, serving as the central platform that connects and allows communication between various components such as the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripheral devices. It hosts crucial components like the chipset, which manages data flow between the processor, memory, and other peripherals, as well as expansion slots for additional hardware such as graphics cards and network cards. The design and capabilities of a motherboard significantly influence the performance, expandability, and features of a computer system." },
  { title: "Mini Articles - Network Interface Card", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller", description: "A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. It allows the computer to communicate with other computers and devices over a local area network (LAN) or the internet. NICs can be wired, using Ethernet cables, or wireless, using Wi-Fi technology. They play a critical role in data transfer and network communication, affecting network speed and reliability. Modern computers often have built-in NICs, but additional cards can be installed for enhanced network capabilities." },
  { title: "Mini Articles - Operating System", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", description: "An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling the execution of applications and providing essential features such as multitasking, memory management, and file system handling. Common operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux distributions, and mobile OSes like Android and iOS. The choice of operating system can impact the usability, compatibility, and performance of a computer." },
  { title: "Mini Articles - Optical Disc Drive", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_drive", description: "An Optical Disc Drive (ODD) is a disc drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs.
