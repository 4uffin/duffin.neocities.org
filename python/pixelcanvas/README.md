# Pixel Canvas Game 🎨

A simple and fun pixel art tool built with Python and Tkinter. Draw with solid colors or pixelated image brushes on a grid-based canvas. Great for Minecraft-style block designs or just messing around with pixels!

**NOTE:** I know this idea is not very original, I've wanted to make this for a while, so I did.

*Inspired by Minecraft and r/place*
