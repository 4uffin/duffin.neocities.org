# Audio Player

This project is a simple web-based audio player interface with controls, a file upload feature, and a visualizer. It allows users to upload audio files (in MP3, WAV, or OGG format) and play them with basic playback controls such as play, pause, and stop. Additionally, the visualizer provides a graphical representation of the audio frequencies in real-time.

## Features

- **Audio Playback Controls**: Users can play, pause, and stop audio playback using the provided buttons.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload audio files from their local device to play within the player.
- **Visualizer**: The visualizer displays a graphical representation of the audio frequencies, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.
- **Equalizer Controls**: Users can adjust the bass, mid, and treble levels using range sliders to customize their listening experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The player interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language used for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling language used for designing the layout and appearance of the player interface.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for implementing interactive features such as audio playback and visualizer.
- **Web Audio API**: JavaScript API used for processing and analyzing audio in the browser.
- **Canvas API**: JavaScript API used for drawing the visualizer graphics on a canvas element.

## Usage

To use the audio player, simply open the web page in a modern web browser that supports the necessary features (such as audio playback and the Web Audio API). You can then upload audio files using the "Upload Song" button and control playback using the provided buttons. The visualizer will react to the audio being played, providing a visual representation of the sound.
